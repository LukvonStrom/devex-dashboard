### üîç Industry Standard: DORA Metrics

This dashboard implements metrics aligned with the DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) framework, including:

- **Deployment Frequency** - How often your organization deploys code
- **Lead Time for Changes** - How long it takes to go from code committed to code in production

These metrics are powerful predictors of both IT performance and organizational performance.
